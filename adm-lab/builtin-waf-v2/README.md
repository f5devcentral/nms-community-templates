# App Protect configuration

This use case enables App Protect across all URIs within the component.

The prerequisites for this are that the WAF compiler is installed the NMS Host and the App Protect WAF is installed on each instance. For instructions, see https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-management-suite/nim/how-to/app-protect/setup-waf-config-management/.

Currently this is just the basic usecase, which allows the user to enable appProtect and select from the built in options.

Future work will enable custom App Protect policies.
